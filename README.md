## Part 1: Outbound messages (From business to customers)

#### Send a free-formatted text message to a recipient:

```js
await Whatsapp.sendText({
    message: 'Hello world',
    recipientPhone: 'your recipient phone number here',
});
```

    > Quick Question:
    - How does a recipient phone number look like?

    > Quick Answer:
    - A recipient phone number is the international phone number of the recipient without the '+' prefix.
    - For example, where a Kenyan phone number is '+254712345678' we would send the message to a recipientPhone 254712345678.
    - For a phone number +15550253483 we would send the message to a recipientPhone 15550253483.
    - For an US phone number +1 555-555-5555 we would send the message to a recipientPhone 5555555555.

```

##### Generate a QR code which can be scanned by a recipient:

```js
let result = await Whatsapp.createQRCodeMessage({
    message: `Your QR code message here. I am a message hidden in a QR code.`,
    imageType: 'png' || 'svg',
});

let urlOfImage = result.data.qr_image_url;
```

<img src="./static_files/XEIDF3D5FTBDF1.png"
    alt="Markdown Monster icon"
    style="height:250px;width:250px" />
<br/>

#### Mark a message as read:

```js
await Whatsapp.markMessageAsRead({
    message_id: 'the id of your message here',
});
// A non-retryable error will be thrown if the message is not found or a message that has already been read.
```

#### Limitations in outbound actions:

## Part 2: Inbound messages (From customers to business)

#### Parse incoming messages:

```js
// req.body is the body of the request which ping the webhook. Invalid payloads will throw an error, and you should respond with HTTP status 5** or 4**, not 200.
// remember to respond with HTTP 200 status at the end of a succesful inbound request.
let data = Whatsapp.parseMessage(req.body);
/*
data.isMessage will be true if it is a message from a customer, it will be false otherwise.
data.isNotificationMessage will be true if it is a notification from a Meta(e.g a message delivery/read status notification), it will be false otherwise.
data will throw an error if the body of the webhook request is not valid or not from Meta.
*/
```

#### Handling a _SIMPLE_ button click

```js
if (data?.isMessage) {
    let incomingMessage = data.message;
    let recipientPhone = incomingMessage.from.phone; // extract the phone number of the customer
    let recipientName = incomingMessage.from.name; // extract the name of the customer
    let typeOfMsg = incomingMessage.type; // extract the type of message
    let message_id = incomingMessage.message_id; // extract the message id

    if (typeOfMsg === 'simple_button_message') {
        let button_id = incomingMessage.button_reply.id;
        if (button_id === 'book_appointment') {

            // The customer clicked on a simple button whose id is 'book_appointment'.
            // You can respond to them with an outbound action eg, a text message
            await Whatsapp.sendText({
                message: `Hello customer, You clicked on the 'book appointment' button`,
                recipientPhone: 'your recipient phone number here',
            });
        };
    };
```

#### Handling a _RADIO_ button selection

```js
if (data?.isMessage) {
    let incomingMessage = data.message;
    let recipientPhone = incomingMessage.from.phone; // extract the phone number of the customer
    let recipientName = incomingMessage.from.name; // extract the name of the customer
    let typeOfMsg = incomingMessage.type; // extract the type of message
    let message_id = incomingMessage.message_id; // extract the message id

    if (typeOfMsg === 'radio_button_message') {
        let selectionId = incomingMessage.list_reply.id;
        if (selectionId === 'morning_session') {
            // The customer selected the radio button whose id of 'morning_session'.
            // You can respond to them with an outbound action eg, a text message
            await Whatsapp.sendText({
                message: `You have selected the 'morning_session' option`,
                recipientPhone: 'your recipient phone number here'
            });
        };
    };
```
